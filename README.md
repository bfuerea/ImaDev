STEPS TAKEN:

1. Create Repo
2. Update Readme 
3. Clone Repo under my BitBucket/Git Repo main folder
4. Add steps taken (and think about automatically adding commit description in this readme under ~Steps Taken~)
5. Look up "proper HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript folder structure" 
6. Long time to research best folder structure for this simple-yet-expandable project
7. Considering in using NPM. Have used it before in vue.js. Makes life too easy (or too hard - depending on the level of focus)
8. Decided to go simple and scratch the project or branch it if I change my mind later 
9. Creating HTML5 Form. Some resources used: 
    - https://htmlreference.io/forms/
